# Setup

1. Download and install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- If it is already installed, check in terminal:

```
> python --version
```

2. Make sure to have the [latest pip version](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed

```
> python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

3. Install the [pytest playwright plugin](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-playwright/)

```
> pip install pytest-playwright
```

4. Install the required browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit)

```
> playwright install
```

# [Run tests](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/running-tests)

By default tests will be run on chromium, in headless mode:

```
> pytest
```

Using pytest [CLI options](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-runners#cli-arguments) can choose another browser and headed mode:

```
> pytest --browser webkit --headed
```

Run only one test suite

```
> pytest <test_file>.py --headed
```
