2. Make sure to have the [latest pip version](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed

```

# [Run tests](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/running-tests)

### Pre-requisites

Credentials used in tests need to be set as [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1).

In order to see the list of tests:
```
pytest --collect-only
```

By default tests will be run on chromium, in headless mode:

```
pytest
```

Using pytest [CLI options](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-runners#cli-arguments) can choose another browser and headed mode:

```
pytest --browser webkit --headed
```

Run only one test suite

```
pytest <test_file>.py --headed
```

Run all tests from root
```
python -m pytest
```
